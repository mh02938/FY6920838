        The F35 Lightning II is the most advanced multi role combat aircraft to ever exist, to 
        obtain this title engineers at Lockheed Martin combined an incredible weapon system 
        with unparalleled stealth technologies. These have allowed the F35 Lightning II to 
        dominate the skies and remain almost undetectable since it first entered service in 
        2015. This paper will focus on the specifically on the aircraft’s stealth systems, 
        which allow it to enter enemy airspace while avoiding detection by enemy radar and 
        other aircraft.

      Radar Absorbing Materials
    </h3>

        The first of the main radar countermeasures aboard the F35 is the material that coats its outer layer. Whilst the specific material used to coat the fuselage of the F35 has not been publicly disclosed, we do know that it is a type of radar absorbent material (RAM). To understand how RAM works we must first understand how radar works: a simple radar station consists of a electromagnetic (EM) wave transmitter and receiver, it sends out a wave at a known speed and waits for it to return, if the wave returns to the receiver then the radar know it was reflected by another object and uses the speed of the radio wave and the time it took from when the wave was transmitted to when it was received to calculate the how far away the object is. The RAM coating on the F35 absorbs a high proportion of these waves and converts them into heat energy which is dissipated throughout the airframe of the aircraft, meaning that very little EM waves are reflected back to the radar receiver.
