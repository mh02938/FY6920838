        The F-35 Lightning II is the most advanced multi role combat aircraft to ever exist, to obtain this title engineers
        at Lockheed Martin combined an incredible weapon system with unparalleled stealth technologies. These have allowed 
        the F-35 Lightning II to dominate the skies and remain almost undetectable since it first entered service in 2015. 
        This paper will focus on the specifically on the aircraft’s stealth technologies, which allow it to enter enemy 
        airspace while avoiding detection by enemy radar and hostile aircraft.

      Radar Absorbing Materials
    </h3>
    <p class="ex1">
      <pre id="RAMs_InText">
        The first of the main stealth technologies aboard the F-35 is the material that coats its outer layer. Whilst the 
        specific material used to coat the fuselage of the F-35 has not been publicly disclosed, we do know that it is a type
        of radar absorbent material (RAM). To understand how RAMs work we must first understand how radar works: a simple 
        radar consists of a electromagnetic (EM) wave transmitter and receiver, it sends out a wave at the speed of light and 
        waits for it to return, if the wave returns to the receiver then the radar know it was reflected by another object 
        and uses the speed of the radio wave and the time it took from when the wave was transmitted to when it was received 
        to calculate the how far away the object is (Lockheed Martin, 2021). RAM coatings absorbs a high proportion of these 
        waves and converts them into heat energy which is dissipated throughout the airframe of the aircraft, meaning that 
        very little EM waves are reflected back to the radar receiver, this results in the aircraft having a very small radar 
        cross-section or RCS (the perceived size of an object through radar) (Mouritz, 2012). The RAM coatings used on the 
        F-35 are baked into the aircraft’s skin panels meaning that even during deployments on aircraft carriers, where the 
        coating can become discoloured and oxidise, there is a negligible effect on stealth performance (Newdick, 2022). In 
        fact the coating is claimed to get better with each flight as the coating becomes smoother, causing less scattering 
        of em waves (Axe, 2012).

      Airframe Design
    </h3>
    <p class="ex1">
      <pre id="AD_InText">
        Another important feature of the F-35 Lightning II that allows it to remain virtually undetected by radar is the 
        design of its airframe. One feature of the aircraft’s airframe is the use of planform alignment, this is where the 
        edges of the wings and tail are swept back at the same angles, allowing the incident radar energy to be directed away 
        from the source and into empty space where it won’t be detected (Ali and Chadwick, 2016). In addition, unlike older 
        stealth aircraft like the F-117, the F-35’s fuselage features smooth curved facets along its surface (Hayward, 2024) 
        oriented to reflect radar waves away from their source (Allinair, 2025). Another design feature is the internal 
        weapons bay which houses the missiles and bombs (Hayward, 2024), if these weapons were mounted on the outside of the 
        aircraft this could cause excess reflection of incident radar energy and in turn give the aircraft a larger radar 
        cross-section (Allinair, 2025). As well as avoiding radar detection, stealth aircraft must also avoid infrared and 
        optical detection, the main source of heat on any aircraft is the engine, the F35 uses a diverter nozzle and advanced 
        cooling systems (Hayward, 2024) designed by Pratt and Whitney (Hina Dinoo, 2025) to reduce the amount of heat energy 
        emitted.

      Electronic Warfare
    </h3>
    <p class="ex1">
      <pre id="EW_InText">
        The final stealth technology in the F-35’s arsenal is the AN/ASQ-239 electronic warfare (EW) suite manufactured by BAE, 
        this suite gives the F-35 various more offensive and defensive capabilities (BAE, 2025), this paper will of course only 
        be examining the defensive capabilities of this piece of equipment. As anticipated, there is very little detailed 
        information available on the electronic warfare suite as the aircraft is still operational, however, it is known that 
        it at least possesses EW aperture sensors (Lemons and Carrington, 2018) and the ability to jam enemy radars (BAE, 2025). 
        The EW aperture system consists of six antennas listening for radio frequencies (Lemons and Carrington, 2018), this 
        means that the aircraft is able to detect enemy aircraft from the radio frequency they emit instead of using radar which 
        involves emitting radio waves, which could potentially give away the aircraft’s location. Once the EW suite has 
        recognised a hostile radar source it can them disrupt it, this might be done by either focusing a large amount of power 
        on the frequency or frequencies that the radar operates at or altering incident radio waves by delaying the return of the 
        radar and re transmitting them to create false targets at different ranges (JEM Engineering, 2019). This in turn allows 
        the F-35 to remain undetected and even misdirect enemies with false radar readings.

      Conclusion
    </h3>
    <p class="ex1">
      <pre id="Conc_InText">
        In conclusion, while there is not much declassified information about the stealth technologies on modern fighter jets, 
        like the F-35, it is clear that the engineers at Lockheed Martin put great thought into the stealth capabilities of this 
        aircraft, allowing it to rival even the most complex of detection systems. It should be noted that even with all these 
        technologies the F-35 is not completely undetectable, and Iran claims to have shot down 4 Israeli F-35s, however this 
        claim has not yet been verified (Gallo, 2025). The lack of information surrounding the F-35 also means that no accurate 
        estimate for the size of its radar cross-section has ever been made, making it difficult to determine the efficacy of the 
        airframe design, radar absorbent materials and EW suite in maintaining a low observability.
